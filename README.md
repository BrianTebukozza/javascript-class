JavaScript (JS) is a versatile programming language that runs on the web, used to create interactive websites and web applications.

It is **client-side**, meaning it runs in your browser, though it can also run on the **server-side** using environments like Node.js.

JavaScript is commonly used alongside **HTML** (structure) and **CSS** (styling) to create dynamic web pages.
